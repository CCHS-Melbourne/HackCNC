These are the pinouts for the Freetronics CNCPlotter board developed by Luke Weston.
This board is built around an Arduino Leonardo chip.
By default, the board is set to 8x microstepping.  This can be changed by soldering headers on the 3 pads for each driver board.
The CNCPlotter board only has two stepper drivers, with a servo for it's third axis.  An additional driver board can be connected to D5 and D13.

D0: UART RXD (not used, broken out to spare header)
D1: UART TXD (not used, broken out to spare header)
D2: LCD Strobe (Data loaded serially from AVR into 8-bit latch. Same as Pebble LCD hardware.)
D3: LCD Data
D4: LCD Clock
D5: Z-axis direction (not used in most cases)
D6: SD Card SPI chip select (active low). Standard SPI hardware (MOSI, MISO, SCK) used for SPI communications with SD card.
D7: Z-axis limit switch input (not used in most cases)
D8: Y-axis step signal
D9: Y-axis direction signal
D10: X-axis step signal
D11: X-axis direction signal
D12: Servo motor PWM position signal
D13: Z-axis step signal (not used usually)

A0: Touchscreen 1
A1: Touchscreen 2
A2: Touchscreen 3
A3: Touchscreen 4
A4: Y-axis limit switch input
A5: X-axis limit switch input
