This folder contains the necessary elements for building an Arduino compatible 32u4 microprocessor firmware for interfacing with LinuxCNC.

digitalWriteFast is an Arduino library dependancy and should be copied to the libraries sub-folder of the arduino IDE base folder before compiling the EMCArduino_07b firmware. EX: ~/arduino-1.0.1/libraries/digitalWriteFast

EMCArduino_07b_32u4 is the development firmware compatible with an Arduino based on a AT32u4 micro.

linuxcnc is an example set of configuration files that work with the HackCNC. These are normally accessed by LinuxCNC if copied to ~/linuxcnc.
