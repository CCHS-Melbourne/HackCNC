Francisco gets all the credit for doing the original work of making a modular
LiquidDisplay library. This code was forked off Francisco's code:
http://hg.bijland.net/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal
https://bitbucket.org/fmalpartida/new-liquidcrystal/wiki/Home

In turn, Raron used Francisco's code and made this shift register library:
http://code.google.com/p/arduinoshiftreglcd/

This is where I came in, by writing LiquidCrystal_SR_LCD3, was forked off
LiquidCrystal_SR which unfortunately does not use the same wiring.
I targetted the code for the Pebble and Pebblev2 (just released by freetronics
in the arduino miniconf as part of linux.conf.au 2012) and therefore this code
organizes the output data differently.

Pinout for this code is used by all derivatives of the original LCD3Wire page:
http://www.arduino.cc/playground/Code/LCD3wires

This includes the LCA (linux.conf.au) Arduino Miniconf Pebble: 
http://shieldlist.org/luke-weston/pebble
https://github.com/lukeweston/Pebble

It also includes the Pebble v2:
http://www.arduinominiconf.org/index.php/Pebble_V2.0_Instructions
http://www.freetronics.com/pages/pebble-v2
https://github.com/lukeweston/pebble20/blob/master/README.md
https://github.com/lukeweston/pebble20/blob/master/pebble-sch.pdf

Pebbles and the LCD3Wires design are compatible hardware-wise, but
the LCD3Wire code does not work with arduino 1.0 anymore and is generally
quite limited in functionality compared to this framework that provides the
entire LiquidDisplay functionality.

Why write LiquidCrystal_SR_LCD3 and not just use the LiquidCrystal_SR pinout?
- LCD3Wire was first and therefore have hardware that was designed with 
  incompatible (IMO better if you don't mind 3 wires) pinout.
- The pinout used here is same saner (the 4 bits for the LCD are all in one 
  nibble of the shift register, not spread across 2 like in the
  LiquidCrystal_SR pinout)
 
This code makes sure to properly follow the specifications when talking
to the LCD while using minimal delays (it's faster than the LCD3wire and aiko
pebble code).
